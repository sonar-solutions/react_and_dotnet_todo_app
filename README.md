## Todo App built using ReactJS and Dotnetcore
The intent of this project is to showcase being able to do a SonarCloud single scan on a ReactJS and Dotnetcore monorepo project, and ingest both the reactjs and dotnetcore codebases into SonarCloud in a single scan - inclusive of both their LCOV and OpenCover code coverage reports.
